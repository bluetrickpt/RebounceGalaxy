# RebounceGalaxy

My first attempt to build a game from scratch using the Phaser.io Engine.

The purpose of this game is for me to learn how to use the Paser.io Engine and a little bit of javascript on the way whilst having fun.

The game consists of a simple rectangular arena where the player can move in a 2d perspective. Enemies while come from random points with different abilities and the player has to hunt them down. The only problem is that the player can "shoot" different elements and these elements won't disappear after the shot. That is, the shots will bounce of walls and enemies, damaging everything (even the player) on their way. So, the more the player shoots, the hard the game gets as shots are bouncing from everywhere!
